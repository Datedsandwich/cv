      Programmer, and also as a Full Stack Web Developer, on a variety of

      I have a preference for Front-End development, I enjoy the rapid, visual,
      feedback loop. I also find that modern front-end frameworks are a pleasure
      to work with.

      Currently, I'm a big fan of ReactJS and ES6, and have a bit of a
      reputation in my office for proselytising about GraphQL.
